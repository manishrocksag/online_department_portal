      <p align="justify" > <b> "Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind" - Donald E. Knuth </b></p>
      <p align="justify" >Dr. Knuth's quote suggests, exactly where the
      computer scientists step in. Seemingly their
      job is only to interact with the computers
      efficiently. But their challenge is to put
      innovative features in a computer so that the
      computers can do whatever we think the
      computers can not do just yet - be it reading
      one's mind or predicting future. Simply put,
      the goal of studying a subject is to make
      improvements in the field of study. The
      subjects, taught as a part of a degree
      curriculum, are the building blocks of the
      computer science knowledge of a student. But
      unless this plethora of knowledge is exercised
      to successfully excute a hands-on project,
      justice is not done on the knowledge at hand.
      Open forum and good environment for.
      teacher-student interaction can only increase
      the intensity, magnitude and quality of the
      work. This is the model that the department of
      Computer Science and Engineering at Heritage
      Institute of Technology has been following for
      years. The faculty members have been
      working with the students hand-in-hand to
      strike the right balance for an excellent
      working  environment  and  to  produce
      successful computer scientists, engineers and
      entrepreneurs. </p>
      <p align="justify" > Heritage  Institute  of  Technology  was
        established by Kalyan Bharati Trust in 2001 at
        Anandapur, Kolkata. In the department of
        Computer Science and Engineering, a team
        consisting of thirty teaching and technical
        staffs work tirelessly with the students to give
        them a learning experience of international
        standard.  Laboratories  with  updated
        computers with high-end configuration adds
        to that experience. Researchers from the
        department  have  been  publishing  their
        original works in top ranked international
        conferences and journals. Collaboration with
        elite national and international institutes
        provides students the exposure to keep up
        with the state-of-the-art in the subject.
        Workshops, seminars and presentations are
        organized to encourage independent research.
        Students have recently formed an ACM
        student  chapter  to  encourage  technical
        activities within the department. The students
        organize technical events within the institute
        and also participate heavily in the technical
        events organized within the institute as well
        as in other premiere academic institutes. </p>
      <p align="justify" ><b>--words from our  CSE technical Magazine </b> </p>
      <p align="justify" >This portal has been an endeavor by we, students,
      to give the department a platform, to interact and stand united.</p>
